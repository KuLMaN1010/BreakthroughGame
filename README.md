Overview
This project implements intelligent agents to play the classic board game, Breakthrough.

Implemented the agents using powerful search algorithms: Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.

Designed and tested multiple heuristics (offensive, defensive, hybrid) to optimize agent decision-making and strategy.

Evaluated performance through extensive self-play matchups, demonstrating a strong balance of efficiency, strategic depth, and compelling gameplay visualization.
